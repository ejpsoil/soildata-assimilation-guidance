# EJPSoil Data assimilation and dissemination Guidance

This repository has been set up as a colaborative space for working on a cookbook on guidance for Soil Data assimilation and dissemination.

Documentation is maintained in the [docs](docs) folder as [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and is published at an online location at intervals using [MKdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). 

In the [docker folder](docker) some docker compose files are kept for each of the cookbooks for which it is relevant.
