This repository has been set up as a collaborative space for working on a cookbook on guidance for Soil Data assimilation and dissemination.

Documentation is maintained in the [docs](docs) folder as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and is published at [an online location](https://ejpsoil.github.io/soildata-assimilation-guidance) at intervals using [quarto](https://www.quarto.org).

In the [docker folder](docker) some docker compose files are kept for each of the cookbooks for which it is relevant. 

Build and preview the docs locally

```
cd docs
