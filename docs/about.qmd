The EJPSoil project includes a work package dedicated to empower soil data providers in harmonizing and publishing soil data. This cookbook is one of the tools. Other tools provided are the [EJPSoil Catalogue](https://catalogue.ejpsoil.eu). 

This cookbook is a collaborative effort to collect and describe hands-on good practices on data assimilation in the 
[Soil](https://agrovoc.fao.org/browse/agrovoc/en/page/c_7156) domain, with a focus on Europe. The [INSPIRE](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/) directive 
has been and is an important effort for standardisation in the environmental data domain, therefore this WIKI has a lot of links to INSPIRE sources. 
Because INSPIRE adopts industry standards, this cookbook does reference common standards from [ISO TC211](https://www.iso.org/committee/54904.html), [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://opengeospatial.org) (OGC), [Global Soils Partnership](https://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/en/) (GSP), 
[International Assigned Numbers Authority](https://www.iana.org/) (IANA) and [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/) (W3C), giving it a global relevance.

The term `data assimilation` has been chosen by the autors as an alternative to the terms harmonisation and standardisation, which already have a 
specific meaning in the soil domain:

- `standardisation`; aligning soil data to a common model, using common codelists.
- `harmonisation`; transforming results from observations and measurements to values as if all results for a property are measured using the same procedure, by applying so called [Pedotransfer Functions (PTF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedotransfer_function).

The cookbook has been initiated by ISRIC - World Soil Information and Wageningen University as part of 2 workshops for Soil Data Providers, held in 
2022 and 2023 in the scope of the [EJPSoil project](https://ejpsoil.eu). The EJPSoil project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s horizon 2020
research and innovation programme under grant agreement [No. 862695](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/862695).
