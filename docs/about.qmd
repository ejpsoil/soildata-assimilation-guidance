This WIKI is a collaborative effort to collect and describe hands-on good practices on data assimilation in the [Soil](https://agrovoc.fao.org/browse/agrovoc/en/page/c_7156) domain, with a focus on Europe. The [INSPIRE](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/) directive has been and is an important effort for standardisation in the environmental data domain, therefore this WIKI has a lot of links to INSPIRE sources. Because INSPIRE adopts industry standards, this WIKI does reference common standards from ISO, Open Geospatial Consortium, Global Soils Partnership, IANA and W3C, giving it a global relevance.

The term `data assimilation` has been chosen by the autors as an alternative to the terms harmonisation and standardisation, which already have a specific meaning in the soil domain:

- `standardisation`; aligning soil data to a common model, using common codelists.
- `harmonisation`; transforming results from observations and measurements to values as if all results for a property are measured using the same procedure, by applying so called [Pedotransfer Functions (PTF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedotransfer_function).

The wiki has been initiated by ISRIC - World Soil Information and Wageningen University as part of 2 workshops for Soil Data Providers, held in 2022 and 2023 in the scope of the EJPSoil project.
