Hale Connect is a [Software as a Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) solution provided by [wetransform](https://wetransform.to) to provide view and download services with metadata for rich datasets, such as those following the INSPIRE data models. Transformations are prepared in [Hale Studio](hale-studio.qmd) and effectuated in the Hale Connect Solution.

The services are  optimised for ease of use and performance, due to the cloud native setup of the data services. A data space connector is in preparation.
