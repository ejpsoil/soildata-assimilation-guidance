# Capacity testing with jmeter

*status: in progress* 

[jmeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) is a utility which can run a series of performance and capacity tests on a webservice.

## Installation

Jmeter is a java program, which can run on most platforms (if java is installed). Download the latest version from the [apache website](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi). Unzip the archive and run `jmeter.bat` from bin directory.

Jmeter may be quite overwhelming at first, the number of options is high. Follow the tutorials to get introduced to the basic aspects.

## Web test plan

Jmeter is typically used to test the performance and capacity of a website or webservice. 

- Start Jmeter and follow the [build web test plan](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/build-web-test-plan.html) tutorial. 
- Create a web testing plan in jmeter and add a list of sample requests (WMS/WFS/WCS, getcapabilities/getmap/getfeatere etc).

- Run the test against the webservice 
- Run the test with multiple users, notice the performance decrease of the service. 

!!!note

    Do not perform a load test against a production url, it wil severely impact the performance of that service. 

## Samples of requests:

- http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wms?request=getcapabilities
- http://localhost:8080/geoserver/ows?request=getcapabilities&version=2.0.0&service=wfs
- http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wcs?request=GetCapabilities&version=1.1.1&service=wcs
- http://localhost:8080/geoserver/gwc/service/wmts?REQUEST=getcapabilities
- http://localhost:8080/geonetwork/srv/eng/csw?REQUEST=GetCapabilities&version=2.0.1&service=CSW
