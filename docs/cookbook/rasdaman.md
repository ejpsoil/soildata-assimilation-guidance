# Coverages with rasdaman

[Coverage data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverage_data) is the digital representation of some spatio-temporal phenomenon. Usually in the form of a grid of cells having a certain resolution. Grid cells can provide a value for multiple phenomena. The [OGC Web Coverage Service](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wcs) and the upcoming [OGC API Coverages](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/coverages/) provide a standardised mechanism to query coverage data over the web. Web Coverage Service is the main option to [provide a Download service on INSPIRE coverage data](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/id/document/tg/download-wcs). An alternative option is [INSPIRE Atom](./webdav.md).

[Rasdaman](https://rasdaman.org) is software to set up a Web Coverage Service. The Rasdaman team has prepared a tutorial for setting up an INSPIRE Coverage service at
[Good practice on coverage data](https://inspire.rasdaman.org/). The tutorial is set up using Jupyter. New to Jupyter? Read the [Jupyter recipe](../utils/jupyter.md).
