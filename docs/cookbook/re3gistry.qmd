# Re3gistry

*Status: contribution needed*

[Re3gistry](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry) is a tool to manage and share reference codes.  It provides a central access point that allows labels and descriptions for reference codes to be easily looked up by humans or retrieved by machines. It supports organisations in managing and updating reference codes consistently in a well governed manner so that all versions of a code remain traceable and adequately documented over time.

The Re3gistry development started under the ISA Are3na action. It continues under the ISA2 ELISE action. The main user of the software is the [INSPIRE Registry](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/registry). Although the software has been implemented in [various regional instances](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/re3gistry_en/).

When you need to manage and share reference codes within and between organisations, the Re3gistry solution can support you. These reference codes uniquely define sets of permissible values for a data field or provide context for the exchanged data. Examples of reference codes are simple enumerations and flat lists to complex controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri.

## Registry in relation to other software

Tools such as [GeoNetwork](./geonetwork.qmd) and [Hale studio](./hale-studio.qmd) are able to import code lists from Re3gistry software. Which are then used within the software to populate pull down menus.

## Registry and the semantic web

The background of Re3gistry is in the geospatial domain (iso19135). Hoewever there are efforts to integrate with the semantic web. Each codelist can for example be exported as a SKOS RDF, for example in an [rdf/xml format](http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/metadata-codelist.en.rdf)
