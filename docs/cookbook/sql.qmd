# SQL & python

*Status: in progress*

This recipe implements the GeoPackage Good Practice for Soil Data by converting a sample soil database to GeoPackage based on the INSPIRE Soil Model using SQL statements from a Python environment.

REQUIREMENTS
- basic understanding of python and sql concepts
- running environment python, pip, virtualenv (or alternative)

Setup a python environment

```
virtualenv soildata
cd soildata
. bin/activate
```

Clone the workshop environment and install python requirements

```
git clone 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

As a soil database we use the [SOTER database of Cuba](https://data.isric.org/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/f31ac19f-67a4-4f64-94cc-d4f063ea9add) which is available as Microsoft Access mdb as well as SQLite.
