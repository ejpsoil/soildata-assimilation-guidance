This article describes the `data and information sharing` step in the [Soil Information Workflow](https://www.isric.org/index.php/utilise/community-practice) and references various cookbook recipes related to this step in the workflow.

In this step the data curator manages processes that maintain discovery, view and download services on the web. The main activity is probably the creation of new services, as part of that activity it should be assessed if the services comply with the relevant regulation. Another important activity is the monitoring on [Quality of service](QOS.qmd).
