# Jupyter notebooks

*Status: in progress*

Jupyter notebooks are a combination of text and code (*JU*lia, *PYT*hon and *R*), the code can directly be run within the notebook. Jupyter notebooks are mainly used in training or documentation settings in data science. Some argue that jupyter notebooks will replace articles in scientific magazines to communicate research results.
