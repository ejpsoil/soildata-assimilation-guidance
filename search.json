    "text": "Git is a distributed version management system of mainly text files to facilitate shared development of software and/or documentation. Git is one of the creations of Linus Torvalds. In Git everybody checks out the full repository with all its history, you make changes to a version locally and push them back to the server. In the process incidental conflicts may occur, if someone else has made a change in the same version and line as you. The server will reject the push until you resolved the conflict.\nGit is mainly operated from the command line, but a lot of client software is available to facilitate participation. An example is SmartGit, which provides an easy to use interface to manage even complex git tasks such as fixing conflicts. Git GUI is the graphical user interface included with the Git software suite.\nGitHub.com is a well known provider of Git services. They offer a lot of additional functionality on top of the Git version management, such as a web interface, issue management, forking & pull requests, wiki, actions, etc.\nGitlab is a popular open source software stack offering a similar set of functionalities as GitHub, you can use it as SAAS or install it on a server.\nIn 2020 various code forges based in the United States arbitrary blocked access to users from countries deemed hostile. This action affected foreign students and scientists working in Europe or collaborating with European institutions. That same year a community of European software developers registered a non-for-profit in Germany to support an independent code forge hosted in Europe. The result is Codeberg, a free, open source, Git-based code forge accessible to everyone in the world.\nAn interesting quick start to Git is written by Roger Dudler (multiple translations). Or if you prefer a video.\nThe main reference for this software is the Git Book."

Docker images are build locally from a Dockerfile (recipe) or downloaded from a repository such as dockerhub. Learn more about docker in the Docker Overview.\nIn this recipe we run most examples using Docker, because in this way there is no need to install any software on your computer, which may either not be allowed, give errors due to missing dependencies or in a worse case scenario can corrupt an existing configuration.\nOn Windows and Apple we recommend to install Docker Desktop. Docker Desktop provides an additional panel to manage running containers. On Linux you can install docker engine. Start docker engine from the start menu, if it is not already running. A general check can be triggered by typing docker ps in a console, this will provide a notification of docker availability and running containers.\nIn this recipe we will use the following Docker concepts:\nInstead of running containers for permanent server applications, you can also start a container to run a short process, similar to running a command line utility.

It only requires the declaration of a new instance and its association with the respective site, in essence just two triples. To do so two URIs must be created, one for the profile and another for the site.\nThe Listing below shows a complete example creating URIs according to the policy used for the World Soil Information Service (WoSIS). The CONSTRUCT clause in the query is pretty vanilla, whereas in the WHERE clause the URIs are created with the BIND and URI functions. The important thing to note in this query is the use of column names in the CSV file as variables, ?site_id and ?profile_id. tarql matches every variable with the CSV columns, replacing them with the corresponding values.\nPREFIX rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;\nPREFIX glosis_pr: &lt;http://w3id.org/glosis/model/profile#&gt;\nPREFIX iso28258: &lt;http://w3id.org/glosis/model/iso28258/2013#&gt;\n\nCONSTRUCT { \n    ?uri_profile rdf:type glosis_pr:GL_Profile ; \n               iso28258:Profile.profileSite ?uri_site .\n}\nWHERE {\n    BIND (URI(CONCAT('http://wosis.isric.org/site#', ?site_id)) AS ?uri_site)\n    BIND (URI(CONCAT('http://wosis.isric.org/profile#', ?profile_id)) AS ?uri_profile)\n}\nExercise: try running this example using the profile.sparql file in the tarql folder against the SoilData.csv file. You should issue a command like:\n$ tarql tarql/profile.sparql data/SoilData.csv\n\n\nRemove duplicates\nBy default tarql generates a triple for each line in the CSV file. Most likely the data in the CSV is not normalised, and thus many duplicates result. You can observe this with the example for the Profile class above.\nThe tool provides a specific argument to deal with duplicates: --dedup. It suppresses all duplicate triples up to a given line in the output. In general you will want to use this argument with a large enough number to cover all the triples produced.\n$ tarql --dedup 1000 tarql/profile.sparql data/SoilData.csv\nIf your only intention is to load tarql’s output to a triple store, you might not need to worry about duplicate triples. Most likely the software automatically discards the duplicates on load.\n\n\nSite\nThe next example deals with the Site class, whose instances are spatial features. Therefore an additional instance of the GeoSPARQL Point class must be created, with the associated geometry literal. The BIND and URI are again at your service to create the URIs. The STRDT function is used to create the geometry instance with the appropriate type. The listing below is available in the file site.sparql.\nPREFIX rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;\nPREFIX geo: &lt;http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#&gt;\nPREFIX glosis_sp: &lt;http://w3id.org/glosis/model/siteplot#&gt;\n\nCONSTRUCT { \n    ?uri_site rdf:type glosis_sp:GL_Site ;\n              rdf:type geo:Feature ;\n              geo:hasGeometry ?uri_geo .\n\n    ?uri_geo rdf:type geo:Point ; \n             geo:asWKT ?geom .\n}\nWHERE {\n    BIND (URI(CONCAT(\"http://wosis.isric.org/site#\", ?site_id)) AS ?uri_site)\n    BIND (URI(CONCAT(\"http://wosis.isric.org/geometry#\", ?site_id)) AS ?uri_geo)\n    BIND (STRDT(CONCAT(\"POINT(\", $lon, \", \", $lat, \")\"), geo:wktLiteral) AS ?geom)\n}\nExercise: try modifying the query above so that it produces a GML literal instead of WKT. Which of the literals do you prefer?\n\n\nLayer\nInstances for the layer should not be a challenge, after succeeding with sites and profiles. The list below provides and example, creating triples relating the layer to the respective profile and declaring its extent with ISO-28258 predicates.\nPREFIX rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;\nPREFIX glosis_lh: &lt;http://w3id.org/glosis/model/layerhorizon#&gt;\nPREFIX iso28258: &lt;http://w3id.org/glosis/model/iso28258/2013#&gt;\n\nCONSTRUCT { \n    ?uri_layer rdf:type glosis_lh:GL_Layer ; \n        iso28258:ProfileElement.elementOfProfile ?uri_profile ;\n        iso28258:ProfileElement.upperDepth ?Top ;\n        iso28258:ProfileElement.lowerDepth ?Bottom .\n}\nWHERE {\n    BIND (URI(CONCAT('https://example.org/layer#', ?Layer)) AS ?uri_layer)\n    BIND (URI(CONCAT('https://example.org/profile#', ?Profile)) AS ?uri_profile)\n}\nExercise: save the query below in a file and use tarql to run it against the SoilData.csv file.\nAdvanced exercise: hop on to the WoSIS RDF pilot and verify how a GloSIS Observation instance is formed.

    "text": "deegree is an open source java server implementation of WMS, WMTS, CSW, WCS, WFS, WPS.\nThis cookbook gives step-by-step instructions on the deegree WFS setup for serving rich GML data, in this case an INSPIRE soil data set.\nThere are two options in which deegree can be used to publish rich GML data.\n\nUsing a relational database and a mapping configuration to generate the GML\nUsing a blob storage to provide individual features without any processing\n\nThe second approach is easy to setup and efficient when users request full datasets. However, it may still be problematic if users use advanced filters to select subsets of the chosen dataset.\n\n\n\nGet started with deegree\nStart a deegree instance locally using the Docker Hub image:\n\nStep 1: Pull the desired docker image\nLatest minor version\ndocker pull deegree/deegree3-docker:3.5\nSpecific version (example)\ndocker pull deegree/deegree3-docker:3.5.3\n\nInfo: All available images of deegree version 3.5.x are built with Apache Tomcat 9.x and OpenJDK 11. Check the deegree Docker Hub project for details and other deegree versions available.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Set up the docker network:\ndocker network\ndocker network create -d bridge inspiresoilnetwork\n\nInfo: A Docker network is a virtual network that allows containers to communicate with each other and with external networks.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Set up the local deegree docker container\nSimple configuration (recommended for beginners)\ndocker run --name deegree_inspire_soil --network=\"inspiresoilnetwork\" -d -p 8080:8080 deegree/deegree3-docker\nor with a specific version:\ndocker run --name deegree_inspire_soil --network=\"inspiresoilnetwork\" -d -p 8080:8080 deegree/deegree3-docker:3.5.3\nAdvanced configuration\ndocker run --name deegree_inspire_soil --network=\"inspiresoilnetwork\" -v /path/to/.deegree:/root/.deegree -d -p 8080:8080 deegree/deegree3-docker:3.5.3\n\nTip: Using the docker parameter -v (volume), all prior created deegree workspaces that are stored in /path/to/.deegree can be accessed.\n\nAfter an intial startup time, the deegree web console can be accessed under http://localhost:8080/deegree-webservices.\nThe deegree documentation contains a detailed quick start on how to import and operate a sample workspace.\n\n\n\nThe deegree GML tools CLI\nThe generation of SQL DDL scripts, deegree SQLFeatureStore configuration files from GML application schemas and import of GML data in a deegree SQLFeatureStore is managed via command line interface (CLI) tools.\nThe usage instructions of each CLI tool can be printed via:\ndocker exec -w /opt deegree_inspire_soil java -jar deegree-tools-gml.jar SqlFeatureStoreConfigCreator -h \nor\ndocker exec -w /opt deegree_inspire_soil java -jar deegree-tools-gml.jar GmlLoader -h\n\nTip: Instead of the parameter -h, -help or -? can be used as well.\n\nThe GML tools CLIs are described in further detail in the deegree documentation.\n\n\nExample workflow\nThe above mentioned GML tools must be executed in the following order:\n\nSqlFeatureStoreConfigCreator\nGmlLoader\n\nThe following example workflow is based on this INSPIRE soil dataset:\n\nhttps://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb/atom/SO/SO_BoKw2015.zip\n\nDescription of the dataset (german-only):\n\nhttps://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb_daten/beschreibung/SO_BoKw2015.html\n\n\nAttention: The example workflow makes use of the docker exec command, which can only be performed on an already existing docker container. Therefore, the completion of the previous chapter “Get started with deegree” is necessary to proceed further.\n\n\nStep 1: Using the deegree SqlFeatureStoreConfigCreator\nIn the following, the SqlFeatureStoreConfigCreator is used to create a SQL DDL statement that creates a database schema as well as a deegree SQLFeatureStore configuration of the INSPIRE soil schema.\ndocker exec -w /opt deegree_inspire_soil java -jar deegree-tools-gml.jar SqlFeatureStoreConfigCreator -format=all -idtype=uuid -mapping=relational -dialect=postgis -schemaUrl=https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas/so/4.0/Soil.xsd\nIf run successfully, the SqlFeatureStoreConfigCreator will generate the SQL DDL statement as Soil.sql and the SQLFeatureStore configuration as Soil.xml.\n\nTip: The results reside in the directory /opt of the docker container and should be copied into the local filesystem in order to be accessed easily using following docker command: docker cp deegree_inspire_soil:/opt/Soil.xml /destination.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Creating a database\nTo use the previously generated Soil.sql, a database needs to be created. For this example a docker container with a PostgreSQL image (version 12) and the PostGIS extension (version 3.2) is created:\ndocker run --name postgis_inspire_soil --network=\"inspiresoilnetwork\" -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -v /destination/Soil.sql:/ postgis/postgis:12-3.2\n\nInfo: The SQL DDL file Soil.sql is mounted onto the container by using the previously mentioned docker run parameter -v. This way, the file does not have to be copied onto the container after its creation.\n\nIn the next step, the database is established and the SQL DDL statement loaded into it using psql:\ndocker exec -it postgis_inspire_soil psql -U postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE inspire_soil;' -c '\\c inspire_soil' -c 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis;' -f /Soil.sql\n\n\nStep 3: Configuration of the deegree workspace\nFor beginners, the easiest way to configure deegree is via the web console at\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/deegree-webservices.\n\n\nCreate a deegree workspace\n\n\nIn the web console, create a new workspace under\n\ngeneral &gt; workspaces &gt; Create a new workspace\n\nFor this example the workspace is called 'inspire_soil'. After creation, the workspace should appear under:\n\nAvailable workspaces.\n\nThen start the created workspace.\n\n\nCreate a SQL database connection\n\n\nCreate a new SQL database connection under\n\nconnections &gt; databases &gt; Create new.\n\nChoose an identifier, for example 'inspire_soil_db' and select type DataSource (preferred) with XML config example PostgreSQL (minimal) and click Create new.\nThe URL in the XML template needs to be adjusted according to the previously created PostgreSQL docker container as well as the database 'inspire_soil'. The set URL should look like this \"jdbc:postgresql://postgis_inspire_soil:5432/inspire_soil\". The previously chosen password and username also need to be adjusted. Click the button save to save your changes to the XML template.\n\n\nInfo: Since both, the deegree and PostgreSQL docker container, are in the same network, you can use the name of the PostgreSQL docker container as hostname.\n\n\nCreate a SQLFeatureStore\n\n\nCreate a new SQLFeatureStore under\n\ndata stores &gt; feature &gt; Create new.\n\nChoose an identifier, for example 'inspire_soil_fs' and select type SQL with XML config example minimal and click Create new.\nIn the XML editor, delete the existing content (CTRL+A, DEL).\nNext, open the in step 1 created file Soil.xml and select all of its content (CTRL+A, CTRL+C), then paste the content into the XML editor (CRTL+V).\nThe only change necessary is to use the individual identifier of the SQL database connection, which you set in step 2. For example &lt;JDBCConnId&gt;inspire_soil_db&lt;/JDBCConnId&gt;. Click the button save to save your changes to the XML template.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, as in this example, the FIDMapping prefix of certain FeatureTypes needs to be adjusted manually.\nIn this example, the following FIDMapping prefix changes need to be made to the Soil.xml file to match those in the database schema (Soil.sql):\n\n“OMPR_PROCESS_” to “Process_”\n“SO_DERIVEDSOILPROFILE_” to “DerivedSoilProfile_”\n“SO_SOILBODY_” to “SoilBody_”\n“SO_SOILLAYER_” to “SoilLayer_”\n\n\n\nInfo: Alternatively, you can also copy the Soil.xml directly into the workspace with i.e.: docker cp Soil.xml deegree_inspire_soil:/root/.deegree/inspire_soil/datasources/feature/. Remember, that the above mentioned changes (identifier feature store and database connection) still need to be applied.\n\n\nCreate a Web Feature Service (WFS)\n\n\nCreate a new WFS under\n\nweb services &gt; services &gt; Create new.\n\nChoose an identifier, for example 'inspire_soil_wfs' and select service type WFS with XML config example complex and click Create new.\nNext, change the FeatureStoreId to the identifier set in step 3. For example &lt;FeatureStoreId&gt;inspire_soil_fs&lt;/FeatureStoreId&gt;. Click the button save to save your changes to the XML template.\n\n\nReload the deegree workspace\n\n\nOnce the previous steps 1-4 are completed, reload your deegree workspace by clicking the button [Reload]. The button is located at top of the web console interface, right next to your active workspace.\n\nIf your configuration is valid, there should be no red exclemation visible on the web console interface.\n\n\nThis concludes the basic configuration of the deegree workspace.\n\n\nStep 4: Using the deegree GmlLoader\nAfter downloading and extracting the dataset mentioned at the beginning of this example workflow, the file Soil.gml needs to be copied onto the previously created deegree docker container using the following docker command:\ndocker cp path/to/Soil.gml deegree_inspire_soil:/\nLastly, the GmlLoader can be started using the following parameters:\ndocker exec -w /opt deegree_inspire_soil java -Xmx16g -jar deegree-tools-gml.jar GmlLoader -pathToFile=/Soil.gml -workspaceName=inspire_soil -sqlFeatureStoreId=inspire_soil_fs -disabledResources=https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/\n\nInfo: Setting the Java parameter -Xmx16g (value dependant on the resources provided) is highly advisable, to avoid an Java OutOfMemoryError. Further information regarding the parameters of the GmlLoader can be found in the deegree documentation.\n\n\nAttention: The deegree GmlLoader takes around 21 hours to run, since the dataset used in this example is quite large (854,2 MB).\n\nAfter the GmlLoader has run successfully, open the capabilities of the WFS configured in step 3 configured WFS under\n\nweb services &gt; services &gt; inspire_soil_wfs &gt; capabilities.\n\nThe capabilties are also directly accessible at the following address:\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/deegree-webservices/services/inspire_soil_wfs?service=WFS&request=GetCapabilities\n\nLastly, QGIS or any other GIS can be connected the WFS resource. Multiple layers should be visible. Import the layer with the name SoilBody to the layer panel. The visualisation should be similar to the following screenshot:\n\n\n\nVisualisation of the deegree WFS data in QGIS\n\n\nAlternatively, you can prepare a GetFeature request to extract a sample of the data available through the configured WFS. For example:\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/deegree-webservices/services/inspire_soil_wfs?service=WFS&request=GetFeature&version=2.0.0&typeNames=so:SoilBody&count=10\n\n\n\n\nFeatured implementations\nSome implementations of INSPIRE soil data services based on deegree:\n\nBaden Württemberg, Germany\nBrandenburg, Germany\n\n\n\nRead more\ndeegree is maintained by the company lat-lon, among others\n\nWebsite: http://www.deegree.org/\nDocumentation: https://download.deegree.org/documentation/current/html/\nDownload: https://www.deegree.org/download/\nDocker: https://hub.docker.com/r/deegree/deegree3-docker/\nINSPIRE Data Specification on Soil: https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/Themes/127/2892\n\nContributions to the deegree open source project are always welcome!"

    "text": "URN\nURNs are logical identifiers, simply providing a name for a resource. A URN does not indicate where to find or access the resource, only gives it a name. URNs start with the characters urn: to which follows a namespace and then a succession of other strings that identify sub-categories or paths down to the particular resource name.\nThe lex: namespace is used in some countries to identify legislation documents. As an example, a URN to a European Directive: urn:lex:eu:council:directive:2010-03-09;2010-19-UE\nURNs are used to identify books, media works, trade items, shipping vessels and many other resources. In the context of data provision over the internet that are less used, as they do not provide location. However, they can be useful to identify other resources somehow associated with the data in question.\n\nURL\nIn its turn, the URL not only identifies a resource, it also provides a location and the mechanism to interact with it. These are the most commonly used URIs in the Semantic Web and in digital data exchange in general.\nA URL is composed by three broad components:\n\nProtocol: identifies a specific data exchange mechanism, for instance Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or File Transfer Protocol (FTP). It composes the first segment of the URL and is followed by the characters ://. Examples: http://, file://.\nAuthority: an individual or institution responsible for the resource and usually the infrastructure that may provide it on the internet. E.g. isric.org.\nPath: the relative path to the resource within the institutional infrastructure. E.g. /locations/id/123.\n\nAlthough meant to locate resource, URLs may not always do so and be simply used as identifiers. They remain useful as identifiers as they express an authority over the resource. URLs that do not locate a resource are termed as “non dereferenceable”, meaning that when a computer programme attempts to use it no result is obtained."

    "section": "Selecting a URI structure",
    "text": "Selecting a URI structure\nBefore making any data available on the internet, say to publish the result of a transformation into RDF, you must devise an appropriate URI structure. This is particularly important with RDF, as every non-literal element in a knowledge graph must correspond to a URI. But even outside the Semantic Web, URIs are very useful, as they provide unique identifiers on the World Wide Web (WWW) to your datasets, even to each individual datum.\nA simple approach is to construct your URIs with three building blocks:\n\nUse a sub-domain of your institutional domain to identify a single project or dataset. E.g. soil.my-institute.org.\nAdd a path that starts with a name or identifier of the class to which the data instance belongs. This can be a database table, or a OWL or UML class. E.g. /profile.\nComplete the path with a number or string that unequivocally identifies the data instance within the class. If you work with relational databases this may be the table primary key. An example: #prof1.\n\nThe complete template for this approach looks like:\nhttp://project.institution.org/class#identifier\n\nThe WoSIS example\nISRIC is currently working on a pilot service providing data from the World Soil Information Service (WoSIS) as RDF compliant with the GloSIS Web Ontology. You may browse these data at virtuoso.isric.org.\nIn this example the service is identified in the authority segment of the the URI (wosis.isric.org). Then short identifiers for GloSIS classes make the prefix of the URI path, (site, profile, layer, etc). The path suffix is composed by an hash followed by the WoSIS primary key.\nSome examples currently used with WoSIS data:\n\nhttp://wosis.isric.org/site#72007\nhttp://wosis.isric.org/profile#72007\nhttp://wosis.isric.org/layer#64448\nhttp://wosis.isric.org/observation#4357805\nhttp://wosis.isric.org/result#4357805"

Before creating or importing records, verify that the relevant profile is available in the GeoNetwork instance.\nCreation of metadata records is based on templates. For each metadata model a series of templates is available. Users select a relevant template for their use case while creating a new record to describe a resource. Any template is based on a specific metadata model, which determines which properties need to be described and in which format the record will be stored.\nGeoNetwork provides a number of transformation options for crosswalks between metadata models, but you should always consider some loss of information in these crosswalks.

For an exact match the equals operator can be used instead (=). To match more than one keyword, successive FILTER clauses can be concatenated with the or operator (||).\nIf at some point your database is corrupt, you can remove all triples by running:\nDELETE FROM DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD ;\nColin Maundry provides some dcat sample sparql queries.

    "text": "This recipe describes an approach where data is harmonised to a common relational database.\nThe INSPIRE community has recently started an interesting activity to set up guidelines on how to share INSPIRE data as a relational database. More specifically a database in the GeoPackage format, which is a specialisation of the SQLite format. This will result in a series of new good practices on alternative approaches for data harmonization for various INSPIRE themes and use cases.\nIdea behind the activity is that communities around a certain topic come together to develop a common relational model which substantially represents the INSPIRE UML model. This aspect can be validated by providing a mapping document which maps the relational model to the INSPIRE UML or GML model. This activity is supported by a template that communities can use to share their work with the wider INSPIRE community.\nAfter an initial effort of defining and describing the alternative model, a typical workflow to publish harmonised data is as follows:"

The aim of the programme was to develop a global SOTER database at scale 1:1 million that was supposed to be the successor of the FAO-UNESCO Soil Map of the World. A SOTER database with global coverage was never achieved, but SOTER databases were developed for various regions, countries and continents.\nThe picture below shows the database structure of a SOTER database. The database structure allows to store terrain, soil profile up to wet chemistry results.\n\n\n\nSoter schema\n\n\nIn this recipe we’re focussing on the RepresentativeHorizonValues table mostly, which contains observed properties for each horizon."

After the 2022 training Kathy together with colleagues from Fraunhofer IOSB has put together a SoilThings variant of STA. The experiment has proven to be a most interesting use case, it has shown where flexibility has to be added in the STA model (these changes will be integrated in the upcoming 2.0 version of the standard). The cool thing about this API is that it allows you to do queries like the following: give me all plots that contain a profile that contains a horizon on which pH H2O is measured; while the query syntax can be a bit daunting, the other existing technologies for provision (WFS and the new OGC API) would require 5 separate requests to do this.

Because INSPIRE adopts industry standards, this WIKI does reference common standards from ISO, Open Geospatial Consortium, Global Soils Partnership, IANA and W3C, giving it a global relevance.\nThe term data assimilation has been chosen by the autors as an alternative to the terms harmonisation and standardisation, which already have a specific meaning in the soil domain:\nThe process of assimilation also aims to capture additional aspects, such as finding, downloading and using the data. Most of these aspects are also well described as part of the FAIR principles."

On the other hand, minimal implementations tend to be less complex in setup which makes understanding the implementation easier.\nThe traditional implementations have the most active users, so dedicated documentation and tooling is available with high Technical Readiness Level (TRL). However, some technologies are based on conventions of almost 20 years ago. These conventions are outdated, compared to current IT practices.\nAn experimental approach brings the risk of incomplete documentation and tools. Also there is less evidence on usability. But it does give opportunity to use current technologies and engage with the community to design the next iteration of data sharing.\n\nBefore selecting an option evaluate the following aspects in your organization.\n\nWhat are current IT tools and conventions used in the organization to understand which of the approaches fits best with the current knowledge and experience\nCombine an implementation of INSPIRE with business cases that generate direct benefit for your organization or partners. For example, adoption of the open data directive, better documentation and reporting of service levels, improved archival of data, discoverability on search engines.\nAssess the projected audience. Verify that the complexity and nature of the implementation matches with the expectations and capabilities of that audience.\n\nWe recommend to start with a minimal implementation and validate it with the provided compliance test tooling. From there, extend the implementation while continuing the tests with each iteration. With such an you are able to focus on the important aspects and prevent caveats early on in the process."

Roughly 2 approaches, with various implementation options, exist to maintain metadata within an organisation:\n\nMetadata is included in the data file or is stored as a sidecar file next to the actual data file. At intervals a crawler imports metadata to make the data findable from a central location.\nMetadata is captured in a separate system and linkage is maintained between the actual dataset and its metadata.\n\nThe second option is relatively easy to adopt, however it comes with a potential big effort to keep the metadata system in sync within the organisation. In practice organisations tend to implement a combination of both options.\nThis step includes the organisation of data arriving from external sources and the standardisation of that data with local data (transform to a common model). As soon as a user imports a remote dataset for use in a project, it is useful to include a metadata record about that dataset in the local repository, so colleagues understand where/when the data was imported. If the dataset is available online, it is better to link to the remote dataset, so users would always use the latest version."

Essentially, the initial goal of any Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) is to describe its content. Metadata of datasets and services is described in documents, which are made accessible via a discovery service as records in a catalogue.\nCapturing metadata prior and during data collection is an aspect of step 4) data organization in the soil information workflow, publishing the metadata as part of the data dissemination is an aspect of step 6) data and info sharing. Evaluating the findability of datasets and assessing broken links on existing metadata is an aspect of step 7) Soil Information User Consideration.\nIn the soil domain we generally have 2 types of datasets, actual soil observations (calcium content in a horizon of a soil profile at a certain date or a soil profile field classification) and derived grids or polygon maps which represent parameter or soil type distribution for an area. For the second type of datasets describing the lineage (history) of the data is very important. Typically, you would describe the dataset with point observations in 1 document and link another document, describing the derived dataset, and link it as a parent-child relation. The document describing the derived dataset will contain ‘processing-steps’ describing the model that was used to calculate or derive the parameter or soil type distribution (D6.1 ch 5).

The core of the model is the Observations and Measurements model of the Open Geospatial Community. The ISO28258 model has proven to be generic to capture a lot of soil data use cases, and facilitates interoperability with partners.\nThese days various encodings of the ISO28258 conceptual model are available - A xml/xsd oriented model - A relational model (PostGreSQL) - A semantic web ontology, called GLOSIS Web Ontology\nDuring implantation of ISO28258 limitations of the model are likely to be discovered related to the local Use Cases. These limitations can usually be bypassed by extending the model. In recent years some extensions to ISO28258 have been published, which could be relevant to the your cases. Examples are GLOSIS domain model and the INSPIRE Soil data model. Annex D of TG Soil has a specific example on extending the model for a soil contamination use case. Options for model extensions vary per technology. Wetransform has a dedicated section on model extension on their website, based on an R&D project from 2016.\nAn important activity related to Standardisation is the adoption of common code lists and extending those lists to capture regional conventions.

They are designed to serve as umbrella structures for further specialisation according to local practices. Extension is made in an hierarchical fashion, meaning that each additional item must be a narrower definition of one of the existing items.\nBesides these curated code-lists, the INSPIRE domain model also creates space for code-lists of physio-chemical procedures of soil analysis. These are to be referenced from the Observation instances related to the properties referred above.\nThere is no practical guidance in the Technical Guidelines document on how to extend or create new code-lists towards INSPIRE compliance. This document provides broad guidelines on how to do so with the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS), described ahead."

    "title": "Soil data guidance",
    "section": "Extending code-lists",
    "text": "Extending code-lists\n\nSKOS\nThe SKOS ontology is remarkably simple, actually one of its strengths. At its core are five primitives:\n\nConcept - a unit of thought, an idea, a meaning, a category or an object. Concepts are identified with URIs.\nLabel - a lexical string used to annotate a concept. The same concept may be annotated in different natural languages.\nRelation - a semantic association between two concepts, conveying hierarchy or simply connecting concepts in a network.\nScheme - an aggregator of related concepts, usually forming a hierarchy.\nNote - provides further semantics or definition to a concept. Often used to associate a concept to other knowledge graphs or other external resources.\n\nThe listing below presents an item from the GloSIS code-list for crop classes. Its URI is http://w3id.org/glosis/model/codelists#cropClassValueCode-Ce_Ba, abbreviated with the Turtle syntax to glosis_cl:cropClassValueCode-Ce_Ba. The label for this item is “Barley” in the English language, an annotation also indicates its short notation: “Ce_Ba”. Two object properties provide semantic associations, this item is a narrower definition of the glosis_cl:cropClassValueCode-Ce item (the “Cereals” concept), and is part of the scheme glosis_cl:cropClassValueCode.\n@prefix skos:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#&gt; .\n@prefix glosis_cl: &lt;http://w3id.org/glosis/model/codelists#&gt; .\n\nglosis_cl:cropClassValueCode-Ce_Ba a skos:Concept, glosis_cl:CropClassValueCode;\n        skos:prefLabel \"Barley\"@en ;\n        skos:notation \"Ce_Ba\" ;\n        skos:inScheme glosis_cl:cropClassValueCode ;\n        skos:broader glosis_cl:cropClassValueCode-Ce .\nThe next listing shows the scheme integrating the “Barley” concept above. This object is very similar, with a label providing its name and some notes adding further definition. The literal “table 9” indicates the source of this code-list within the FAO Guidelines for Soil Description.\n@prefix rdfs:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; .\n@prefix skos:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#&gt; .\n@prefix glosis_cl: &lt;http://w3id.org/glosis/model/codelists#&gt; .\n\nglosis_cl:cropClassValueCode a skos:ConceptScheme ;\n        skos:prefLabel \"Code list for CropClassValue - codelist scheme\"@en;\n        rdfs:label \"Code list for CropClassValue - codelist scheme\"@en;\n        skos:note \"This  code list provides the CropClassValue.\"@en;\n        skos:definition \"table 9\" ;\n        rdfs:seeAlso glosis_cl:CropClassValueCode .\nUsing this simple pattern, a hierarchical code-list can be developed further simply using the predicates skos:inScheme, skos:broader and skos:narrower. The predicates skos:topConceptOf and skos:hasTopConcept can be further used to indicate the root items in a concept hierarchy.\n\n\nExtend an INSPIRE code-list with SKOS\nSuppose you intend to publish results of chemical analyses appraising the Zinc content of the soil. The INSPIRE code-lists do not presently include that metal as property, therefore an additional code-list item must be created.\nThe first action is to identify in which code-list the item should be added. Physio-chemical properties like Zinc content appear associated with the Horizon or Layer class in soil ontologies, thus the appropriate code-list is ProfileElementParameterNameValue. Open that URI in your browser an go through the respective r3gistry record.\nAt the bottom of the page r3gistry lists the items for this code-list, in this case they are biological parameter, chemical parameter and physical parameter. Follow the URI to the chemical parameter, in that page there is another list of items, including other metals. The new item for Zinc should therefore be created at this same level in the hierarchy.\nThe list below presents a RDF document defining a new sub-item for Zinc within the physical parameter code-list. The URI for this item is http://example.com/my-soil/zincContent. As this item is not directly in a INSPIRE code-list, its URI must refer to an authority that you control, i.e. you or your institution are the responsible party for the code-list item, its definition and publication. For more on this, check the URI strategy document.\n@prefix skos: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#&gt; .\n@prefix inspire_cl_profile: &lt;http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/ProfileElementParameterNameValue/&gt; .\n@prefix glosis_cl: &lt;http://w3id.org/glosis/model/codelists#&gt; .\n@prefix my_soil: &lt;http://example.com/my-soil/&gt; . \n\nmy_soil:zincContent a skos:Concept;\n        skos:prefLabel \"Zinc content\"@en ;\n        skos:definition \"Zinc content of the soil within a profile element.\" ;\n        skos:broader inspire_cl_profile:physicalParameter ;\n        skos:inScheme inspire_cl_profile: ;\n        skos:related glosis_cl:physioChemicalPropertyCode-Zin .\nThe RDF above contains the basic SKOS elements: a Concept instance, a label, an annotation defining the concept and a reference to the parent item with the skos:broader code-list. The last two triples need a closer look. The item is declared as belonging to a Scheme with the URI http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/ProfileElementParameterNameValue/. While the later is not actually declared as such in r3gistry, it is still important to convey the nature of this item as part of a structured INSPIRE code-list. Finally, the skos:related predicated is employed to refer a similar property in the GloSIS web ontology. This last triple is not at all mandatory, but provides another dimension to the code-list item.\n\n\nExtend a GloSIS code-list\nThe GloSIS web ontology becomes particularly relevant in the sections of the INSPIRE domain model for which code-lists do not yet exist. A prominent case is the list of laboratory procedures to assess physico-chemical properties. As mentioned above, GloSIS includes a specific module for procedures.\nThe listing below presents a RDF document with an extra item for the soil texture procedures code list (SKOS scheme glosis_proc:textProcedure). Compared to the previous example, the most remarkable aspect here is the declaration of a glosis_proc:TextProcedure instance. The latter is a sub-class of the SOSA Procedure class, making the bridge to the Observation instances declared in other GloSIS modules.\n@prefix skos: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#&gt; .\n@prefix glosis_proc: &lt;http://w3id.org/glosis/model/procedure#&gt; .\n@prefix my_soil: &lt;http://example.com/my-soil/&gt; . \n\nmy_soil:textureProcedure-SaSiCl_5-50-2000u a skos:Concept, glosis_proc:TextureProcedure ;\n    skos:inScheme glosis_proc:textProcedure ;\n    skos:topConceptOf glosis_proc:textureProcedure ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"SaSiCl_5-50-2000u\"@en ;\n    skos:notation \"SaSiCl_5-50-2000u\" ;\n    skos:definition \"Sand, silt and clay fractions as used in my country (5-50-2000um)\" .\nThe remaining triples should all be familiar by now. The link to the SKOS scheme is made with the skos:inScheme and skos:topConceptOf predicates. Then come the annotations.\n\n\nCreate a new code-list\nINSPIRE and GloSIS cover quite a good deal of ground with their code-lists. However, there might be circumstances where you may require an entire new code-list to express a domain property specific to your institution or dataset.\nThe examples above already provide the necessary to build a code-list on your own. In summary, these are the steps:\n\nDevise a URI policy, encompassing the code-list and its items.\nCreate a Scheme instance to aggregate the code-list items. The Scheme provides a URI and annotation for the code-list.\nAdd in the top Concept instances with the predicates skos:inScheme, skos:topConceptOf and skos:hasTopConcept.\nIf necessary, add in narrower terms forming a hierarchy with skos:broader and skos:narrower.\nLink items to similar concepts in other ontologies or vocabularies if possible."

    "text": "Publishing your own code-list items\nNow that you extended or even created a new code-list the next step is to publish it on-line. There are three essentials ways of doing so, briefly described below.\n\nA simple on-line RDF file. Save the items or code-list as a RDF document and deploy it to a web server. Fairly easy, but not the most user friendly.\nA knowledge graph deployed to a triple store. Load the RDF document to a triple store or directly create the code-list triples with SPARQL queries. Triple stores usually provide end-points for interaction with SPARQL queries and other mechanisms that facilitate user access/view of the code-list. Virtuoso is a triple store providing these functionalities.\nA SKOSMOS instance. Load the code-list triples into a triple store and then link it to a SKOSMOS instance. This software leverages the SKOS ontology to presnnt code-lists in a user friendly, browsable complex of HTML pages.\n\n\nDereferenceable URIs\nWhen publishing a code-list, it is important to facilitate the resolution of the respective URIs. This promotes accessibility and use of the code-list. With a simple deployment to a web server, the hypothetical URI used above: http://example.com/my-soil can point directly to the RDF file. In this case it is customary the use of the hash character (#) to distinguish different resources within the same file. E.g. http://example.com/my-soil#zincContent for the Zinc item.\nWith more advanced software like SKOSMOS, a mid-layer mechanism is necessary to translate the URIs declared in the RDF into the corresponding pages or services. More about this topic in the Identification document."

Various tools exist which enable to browse through a skos codelist, such as skosmos and vocprez. This recipe introduces a more generic approach to setup a conveniance API on top of a SPARQL endpoint, which can also be used for codelists.\nThe GRLC software creates an OpenAPI facade on any SPARQL endpoint. Users send an OpenAPI request to GRLC, GRLC translates the request to a SPARQL query and forwards it to the SPARQL endpoint, the result of the SPARQL query is returned to the user as json or html.\nFor this recipe you need to have an account on github, login and create a new public repository. This repository will contain the configuration of our new service. At creation, select a MIT or CC-0 license (or add a LICENSE file manually).\nEither clone the repository and work locally or use the webbased Github text editor to create and modify files.\nCreate a new file named endpoint.txt, which contains the SPARQL endpoint we’re going to use for this recipe.\nCreate a new file named urls.yml, wich contains the configuration of our new service.\nWe’re now ready to set up the endpoints of our service. Each endpoint is defined by a SPARQL query, stored as a .rq file. Create a file carbonOrganicProcedure.rq.\nThis query will select all concepts in scheme carbonOrganicProcedure.\nNow navigate your browser to https://grlc.io/api/{github-handle}/{github-project} (replace {gh} with your setup) and notice that GRLC has set up an OpenAPI service for your configuration. Click the method in blue, Try it out and Execute to see the service in action.\nTry to set up more endpoints by creating new .rq files with alternative SPARQL queries (try the query first at https://virtuoso.isric.org/sparql).\nAlso have a look at the GRLC documentation to evaluate decorators you can add to your queries to facilitate pagination, tagging, defaults etc.\nGRLC.io is a service provided by the authors.

    "text": "The YARRRML syntax\nThe RML tools apply data transformations according to a set of rules recorded in a YAML file. This file must respect a specific syntax, named YARRRML. This specification defines a number of sections (or environments) in the YAML file that lay out the structure of the resulting triples.\nThe first of these sections is named prefixes and provides the space for the definition of URI abbreviations, in all similar to the Turtle syntax. Each abbreviation is encoded as a list item and can be used in the reminder of the YARRRML as it would be in a Turtle knowledge graph.\nprefixes:\n rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\n xsd: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\n geo: http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\nNext comes the mappings section, where the actual transformations are encoded. This section is to be populated with sub-sections, one for each individual subject class (or type) necessary in the output RDF. For instance, if the transformation must produce triples for profiles and layers, then a sub-suction for each is necessary. The name of these subject sub-sections is arbitrarily chosen by the user.\nmappings:\n  profile:\n\n  layer:\nFor each subject class sub-section at least one data source needs to be specified in the sources section. The source can be declared within square brackets (i.e. a YAML collection), providing a path to a file followed by a tilde and then a type. The sources section can be more intricate, as YARRRML supports a wide range of different data sources, including flat tables, databases and Web APIs.\nmappings:\n  profile:\n    sources:\n      - ['SoilData.csv~csv']\nThe following sub-section of the class declares the subject and has the simple name of s. Its purpose is to define the URI structure for the instances of the class. In principle this is also the first element that makes reference to the contents of the source file. In the case of CSV, as in this example, the column names are used. They are invoked using the dollar character ($), with the column name within parenthesis. The practical result is the generation of an individual element (subject in this case) for each distinct value found in the source column.\n  profile:\n    sources:\n      - ['SoilData.csv~csv']\n    s: http://my.soil.org#$(profile_id)\nWith the subject defined, triples can be completed with predicates and objects in sub-section po. This section is itself composed by a list, whose items comprise a pair: predicate (item p) and object (item o). The predicate is encoded as a URI in a similar way to the subject, using abbreviations if necessary. As for the object it can be decomposed further into a value and a datatype to accommodate literals.\nThe example below creates triples for the layer class subject, using the layer_id column in the source to generate subject URIs. The source column layer_order is used to complete triples declaring the order of a layer within a profile.\nprefixes:\n xsd: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\n iso28258: http://w3id.org/glosis/model/iso28258/2013#\n\nmappings:\n  layer:\n    sources:\n      - ['SoilData.csv~csv']\n    s: http://my.soil.org#$(layer_id)\n    po:\n      - p: iso28258:ProfileElement.order\n        o:\n           value: \"$(layer_order)\"\n           datatype: xsd:integer\nThe encoding of the predicates and objects list can be shortened with collections. Instead of discriminating value and datatype, they can be expressed as elements of a collection. This formulation is useful when the object is itself a URI. Note how in the example below (for the layer class) the tilde is used again, to indicate the object type.\n    po:\n      - [iso28258:Profile.elementOfProfile, http://my.soil.org#$(layer_id)~iri]\nThis was just a brief introduction to the YARRRML syntax. It goes far deeper, even allowing for some functional programming. While the guidelines in this document make enough of a start to automated RDF generation, the documentation is indispensable to take full advantage of the RML tool set."

Take some time to experiment with these examples, try modifying the output, or even to create further transformation rules.\nEventually you will find the limitations of Matey, while convenient for prototyping, it does not scale for large datasets or to process a large number of source files. For that you need to use the command line interface."

    "text": "How to use\nNote: before starting a data transformation into RDF you must devise a URI policy for your data. Please refer to the URI Policy document for details.\nThe file SoilData.csv contains a simple set of hypothetical measurements referring to three soil profiles collected in two different sites. The goal is to transform this dataset into GloSIS compliant RDF.\nsite_id,lat,lon,profile_id,layer_id,upper_depth,lower_depth,pH,SOC,\n1,49.43,8.31,1,11,0,15,7.4,6,\n1,49.43,8.31,1,12,15,40,7.2,4,\n1,49.43,8.31,2,21,0,10,8,3,\n1,49.43,8.31,2,22,10,30,8.1,2,\n2,46.82,11.45,3,31,0,15,6.8,1,\n2,46.82,11.45,3,32,15,30,6.7,1,\n2,46.82,11.45,3,33,30,60,6.7,0,\n\nProfiles\nThe simplest place to start is with the profiles. There are three essential elements to generate for each profile: - A new URI for the profile; - The declaration of the new profile as an instance of the class GL_Profile; - The association with the respective site.\nBelow are the contents of the file profile.yarrrml that encodes this transformation. Note how the URIs of both the profile and the site are created using the prefixes.\nprefixes:\n wosis_prf: http://wosis.isric.org/profile#  \n wosis_sit: http://wosis.isric.org/site#\n glosis_pr: http://w3id.org/glosis/model/profile# \n iso28258: http://w3id.org/glosis/model/iso28258/2013#\n\nmappings:\n  profile:\n    sources:\n      - ['SoilData.csv~csv']\n    s: wosis_prf:$(profile_id)\n    po:\n      - [a, glosis_pr:GL_Profile]\n      - [iso28258:Profile.profileSite, wosis_sit:$(site_id)~iri]\nTo perform the actual transformation you must first apply yarrrml-parser to create the RML transformation file and then use rmlmapper to obtain the actual knowledge graph. By default rmlmapper creates a Turtle file that is printed to the standard output (STDOUT). You can use the parameters -o to redirect output to a text file and -s to select an alternative serialisation syntax.\nyarrrml-parser -i profile.yarrrml -o profile.rml.ttl\nrmlmapper -s turtle -m profile.rml.ttl\n\n\nSites\nSites are the spatial features in the knowledge graph, therefore they require the creation of appropriate GeoSPARQL instances. Three new elements must be addressed in this transformation: - Declaration of the site as an instance of the class geo:Feature; - Creation of a geo:Geometry instance to host the actual geo-spatial information; - A literal of the type geo:wktLiteral or geo:gmlLiteral to encode the geometry.\nThe file site.yarrrml achieves this transformation. Its contents are reproduced below:\nprefixes:\n geo: http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\n glosis_sp: http://w3id.org/glosis/model/siteplot# \n wosis_sit: http://wosis.isric.org/site#\n wosis_geo: http://wosis.isric.org/geometry#\n\nmappings:\n  site:\n    sources:\n      - ['SoilData.csv~csv']\n    s: wosis_sit:$(site_id)\n    po:\n      - [a, glosis_sp:GL_Site]\n      - [a, geo:Feature]\n      - [geo:hasGeometry, wosis_geo:$(site_id)~iri]\n\n  geometry:\n    sources:\n      - ['SoilData.csv~csv']\n    s: wosis_geo:$(site_id)\n    po:\n      - [a, geo:Point]\n      - p: geo:asWKT\n        o:\n           value: \"POINT($(lon) $(lat))\"\n           datatype: geo:wktLiteral\nThis example also shows the inclusion of two different classes in the same transformation. Note how the Feature is associated with the geometry using the geo:hasGeometry object property. Also important is the creation of the WKT literal, as it requires a verbose declaration of the object to make the type explicit.\n\n\nLayers\nHaving created a transformation for the sites, one for the layers is not much of a challenge. Download the file layer.yarrrml and try it yourself.\nLook carefully at the transformation file, note how the object properties from the ISO28258 module are used to declare the layers depths.\nQuestion: what would be different if in the source dataset horizons were identified instead of layers?\n\n\nMeasurements\nAn example transformation for the measurements in the original dataset is available in the file measurements.yarrrml. The extra elements to address in this transformation are:\n\nInstance of the respective Observation class;\nInstance of the respective Result class;\nRelation between Observation and Result;\nNumerical literal with the measurement result.\n\nQuestion: Identify in the Layer Horizon module of GloSIS which are the units of measurement associated with the Result instances used in this example.\nExercise I: Create a new yarrrml file including all the transformations given above, creating all necessary triples for sites, profiles, layers and measurements. Make sure it is correctly parsed by yarrrml-parser and generate a new, complete, knowledge graph.\nExercise II: Modify the transformation you obtained in the previous exercise so that it declares all pH measurements as resulting from a H2O procedure (water solution)."

Other tools provided are the EJPSoil Catalogue.\nThis cookbook is a collaborative effort to collect and describe hands-on good practices on data assimilation in the Soil domain, with a focus on Europe. The INSPIRE directive has been and is an important effort for standardisation in the environmental data domain, therefore this WIKI has a lot of links to INSPIRE sources. Because INSPIRE adopts industry standards, this cookbook does reference common standards from ISO TC211, Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), Global Soils Partnership (GSP), International Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), giving it a global relevance.\nThe term data assimilation has been chosen by the autors as an alternative to the terms harmonisation and standardisation, which already have a specific meaning in the soil domain:\n\nstandardisation; aligning soil data to a common model, using common codelists.\nharmonisation; transforming results from observations and measurements to values as if all results for a property are measured using the same procedure, by applying so called Pedotransfer Functions (PTF).\n\nThe cookbook has been initiated by ISRIC - World Soil Information and Wageningen University as part of 2 workshops for Soil Data Providers, held in 2022 and 2023 in the scope of the EJPSoil project. The EJPSoil project has received funding from the European Union’s horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 862695."

At this moment there are no known implementations of SOS or STA to provide Soil data. I’m not aware of procedures to download full datasets from a sensor service and transform them, but the use case may not be relevant to sensor data.

Instead a client should consult the service capabilities to evaluate which featuretypes are available and iterate over each of them.\nINSPIRE mandates the availability of a stored query on any WFS which is able to download the full dataset in a single request. This is by far the easiest option to download a dataset. However consider that this option is not provided by some providers.\nThe GDAL utility supports GMLAS (GML Application Schema) and is able to import gml from WFS and store it in for example a database. See the GDAL recipe for an example. Hale studio is also able to import data from a WFS.\n!!! note\nIf you open a rich INSPIRE WFS service in QGIS, you will get unexpected results. In some cases QGIS will be able to extract a geometry and display the layer, but in other cases it will open each featuretype as a table (without geometry). Links between layers and tables are not imported. A [GMLAS plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/gml_application_schema_toolbox/) (based on the GDAL GMLAS functionality) has been developed in 2016, but adoption has been low and the project seems currently unmaintained."

If a value needs to be registered which is not in those registries, organisations have the option to publish an extended version of the code list locally. Code list values are typically provided as a URI referencing the concept in a registry.\nThe soil model has various codelists. Important codelists are the (WRB) soil clasification, the observed soil property and the methods used in the laboratory. It is important to understand if the method used impacts the measured value. For example there are various methods to measure pH, which each give a specific value. Pedo transfer functions exist to recalculate the value based on the method used. Prior to applying a pedo transfer function, you have to map the codelist from the remote dataset to the code list used locally. Some cases can exist:\n\nBoth datasets reference the same value from a common code list\nThe dataset references a remote concept, but it matches with a concept used locally\nThe dataset references a remote concept, but no local representation exists for the concept\nNo information exists on the concept used\n\nOption 1 is optimal, option 2 requires a mapping table (a suggestion can be made to include the concept on the inspire registry), option 3 and 4 are problematic, these cases should be decided on case by case.
